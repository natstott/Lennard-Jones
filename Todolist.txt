Try using custom VFX particle system instead of drawmeshinstanced to render?
https://forum.unity.com/threads/vfx-graph-siggraph-2021-video.1198156/#post-7671445 may linked to an example of this
Or figure out how to solve problem with single pass rendering that only shows half the particles

Create a data table of molecules to simulate, with coloure, mass, charge, wellsize, sigma etc.

Provide choice of calculations in compute shader to include charge, dipole etc.

Break up compute shaders into smaller chunks and test?
